#FootballAPI_Frontend  
This is the frontend part of the FootballApplication.  
Firstly I built the API: https://github.com/aleksandromilenkov/FootballAPI with ASP.NET Web API  
With the help of React.js I built this app where you can Signup, Login, Logout, Search for Footballers, Search for Clubs, Search for Countries, Create all of the previous mentioned, Update, Delete...   
The purpouse of this app is simply to search Football Country Represetnations, Clubs, Players and see their details like where they Play, age, Country and more.   
I'm using protected routes so unauthorized users cannot get the data, you must first login.   
I'm using the following packages:  
  Axios - for better manipulating with my API  
  React-Router-Dom v6 - for navigating easily in the app  
  React-Spinners - for beautiful spinners while waiting when fetching the data  
  React-Toastify - for beautiful messages in the top right corner (either success or warning/error messages)  
  Yup - for validating forms in the frontend
